# 35BY412 Stepper Motor Library
The 35BY412 stepper motor is relatively unsupported and is quite hard to find any details about it at all. It is mainly available from [eBay sellers](https://www.ebay.co.uk/sch/35BY412%20stepper%20motor) and is often connected in a pair.

## Example Programs
Here are a few custom programs written for the 35BY412 Stepper Motor and [X113647 Stepper Shield](https://github.com/tardate/X113647Stepper):
* [StepperTruthTableArduino](https://github.com/Snakey02/35BY412-Stepper/tree/master/Examples/StepperTruthTableArduino) - Basic example of the stepper truth table running in a loop, rotating the stepper clockwise. This program is writen for the Ardunio Duemilanove.
* [StepperTruthTableNodeMCU](https://github.com/Snakey02/35BY412-Stepper/tree/master/Examples/StepperTruthTableNodeMCU) - Basic example of the stepper truth table running in a loop, rotating the stepper clockwise. This program is writen for the Node MCU.
